PPG Sex Mod 2.2 Update :

- Added Clothing, my own clothing system that generates textures in real time,
has a slots system, and seamlessly works with any other mod, without needing to parent a child object. works with gore.
- Added Goblins (male and female) including their respective NSFW mode items
- Bug fix relating to Penetration checks, for object too.
- Added more options to the ~ CONFIG ~.cs file, including a "Inflation" feature in the config that you can toggle if in NSFW Mode.
- Made the cosmic rendering even more advanced, including trail effects that change according to physics- to flow better.
- Reworked a lot of the LimbAddon for optimisation.
- Other quality of life fixes...
- Made a Github https://github.com/Aubarino/PPGADVCharacterMod for the mod.
- Added Config file options for if in NSFW Mode; for Moan sounds, Cum sounds, and "Furry Mode"
- Revised a lot of the censoring code for SFW Mode so its more stable now.
- Reworked titty jiggle to be dependent on titty mass / the size of the rack.
- Reworked the shaft penetration code tip prediction to be relative to the LimbAddon's scale while relative to the main object, including tits too.
- Made Clothing registering entirely automatic simply from what i define in ADVCassets.cs.

X - added default moan audio handling for androids, so they now are different to the detected default of humans from other mods or sources.
